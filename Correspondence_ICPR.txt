Hello,

This is the corresponding author of paper (with ID: 107) for ICPR 2022, titled ‘Leachable Component Clustering'.

I cannot access the provided website, as most google websites are prohibited from visiting in China. Thus, I should have no idea what the detailed contents of the google form is, as well as its usage.

The whole correspondence feedback from ICPR 2022 committee can be checked below, and we just followed the requirements stepwise till submission of final paper and the registration.

Due to the COVID-19, there are many trivials for application to foreign visa in China, especially for the countries beyond Asia. And I do believe that, there would be some other procedures when visitors returned. Consequently, I choose to present our work via online to save academic foundation, and the required ePoster can be found in attachment, which is ready to be presented in ICPR 2022. 


Many thanks and regards,

Subject 	ICPR 2022: Copyright is operational, final submissions due by June 27
Dear Author,

After some delay, we are now ready to accept final versions
of manuscripts for publication with IEEE. There are a
number of steps required to do this, so please follow the
instructions below carefully.

First, proofread your manuscript and ensure that your pdf
document meets the page limits (six pages of text plus
unlimited pages of references).

Second, use the free service at pdf express
(https://ieee-pdf-express.org) to validate your pdf file.
This is necessary to ensure that when the manuscript gets
to the IEEE it meets their standard for publication. The
Conference ID for ICPR 2022 is 56361X. Please note that
PaperCept will also do a digital validation of page size
and margins, using but pdf express will catch some
potential concerns earlier.

Finally, log on to papercept and submit your manuscript. In
this process you will be required to assign copyright of
your paper to the IEEE. The IEEE does allow you to post
copies of IEEE accepted manuscripts under certain
conditions. See
https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/pubs/author_version_faq.pdf
for details of this.

Note that ONLY the designated "Corresponding author" for
your
paper will be able to complete the final submission.

We have extended the deadline for submitting final versions
of manuscripts until the 27th of June. 

Once again, we apologize for the delay and I look forward
to seeing you in Montreal in August.

Hello,

By the way, the weblink for copyright transfer is also suspended, with the following information.

'There is an issue with the connection to your publication's manuscript submission system. Please inform the Publication Chair or Editor and refer to the following error code for assistance: 1002'

I hold no experience for such case.

And I do not know whether it is natural, or else ? ? 

For us, just waiting, or else ?

Hello,


Could I have your attention, please ? I am the corresponding author of the paper ID: 107 submitted to ICPR’22.

I received the decision letter from ICPR’22 in the end of last month, and was required to resubmitted our work with the maximum length of ten pages in IEEE format, as listed below.


********************
Overall, your revised submission can have maximum 10 pages (2 for your rebuttal and 8 for the actual paper to be evaluated). Please note that the intention is to assign the same reviewers from the first round (subject to their availability). A definitive decision on whether the paper is accepted will be made on the basis of the revised manuscript and the Author's Response.
********************




However, another message has been recently received, and stated that, the length of resubmitted paper should be no more than six pages as originally required. And the deadline of 
resubmission has been delayed to April 21st.

Message from The PaperCept Conference Management System


At the request of some of the track chairs, we have pushed
back the deadline for revise and resubmit manuscripts to
April the 21st (a two day extension). Also, to clarify some
confusion in the previous email, the manuscript length for
revise and resubmit is six pages of text, unlimited pages
of references and two pages of rebuttal. The final camera
ready version is six pages of text, unlimited pages of
references and no rebuttal.
********************




As the resubmitted version is quite related to the final result, I would appreciate if you could post an official confirmation for the maximum length of resubmitted paper, as well as the deadline date of resubmission.


I would look forward to your kind feedback.






Many thanks and regards,

Title:
Latent Leachable Component Clustering
Date submitted: January 3, 2022
Type of submission: Contributed paper
Status: Received
Preferred type of presentation: Oral presentation
Award candidate: None
Keywords:
Classification and clustering; Statistical learning theory;
Representation learning
Profile:
Track 1: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning for Pattern
Analysis
Abstract:
Clustering attempts to partition data instances into
several distinctive groups, while the similarities among
data belonging to the common partition can be principally
reserved. Furthermore, incomplete data frequently occurs in
many real-world applications, and brings perverse influence
on pattern analysis. As a consequence, the specific
solutions to data imputation and handling are developed to
conduct the missing values of data, and independent stage
of knowledge exploitation is absorbed for information
understanding. In this work, two novel approaches to
clustering of incomplete data, termed latent leachable
component clustering, are proposed, while self-expressive
clustering is adopted. Rather than existing methods, the
proposed methods handle data imputation with Bayes
alignment and preservation of information volumes in
theory. Due to the simple numeric computation of equations,
the proposed methods are able to reserve calculation
efficiency during iterative learning. Experiments on
several artificial incomplete data sets demonstrate that,
the proposed methods are able to give fascinating
performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
